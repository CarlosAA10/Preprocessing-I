          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Einstein was a phenomenal genius in his radical approach to seeking answers about the universe. An amazing quality of Einstein was his extreme dedication, which others would see as not normal, in researching his theory of General Relativity. Einstein was so obsessed with his research that he would not hesitate by any means to not miss the eclipses to gather evidence to prove his theory of General Relativity. </p>

          <h2>Skills</h2>
          <p>While most of the skills possessed by Einstein were in his understanding of physics and mathematics, he also possessed skills in his field such as:</p>
          <br> 
          <ul>
            <li>Cohesiveness within a group</li>
            <li>Attention to detail</li>
            <li>Project management</li>
            <li>Creating and keeping deadlines</li>

          <h2>General Relativity</h2>
          <p>Albert Einstein published his work on the General Theory of Relativity in 1915. General Relativity is the geometric theory of gravitation that provides a unified description of gravity to be on a plane of space and time, otherwise known as space-time. Particularly, the curvature on the space-time plane is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present.</p>

          <h2>Photoelectric effect</h2>
          <p>in 1905, Einstein published his paper on the Photoelectric Effect. The photoelectric effect was at first a concept put forward by Max Planck, a German physicist, that light waves were tiny bundles or "packets of energy" known as photons or quanta. The photoelectric effect then was known to be the emission of electrons or other free carriers when light hits a material, in the experiments being metal.</p>
