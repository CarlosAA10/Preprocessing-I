      <br>
      <p>Born in June of 1977 in Atlanta, GA, Kanye spent his formative years living with his college professor mother in Chicago. He showed an early talent for writing poetry and began developing rap songs by the age of 13. After attending the American Academy of Art and Chicago State University, West dropped out of college to pursue a career in the music industry. He slowly built a reputation and resume as a music producer, and eventually landed at Roc-A-Fella Records in the early 2000s. Soon he found himself developing songs for big named artists (including Ludacris, Alicia Keys, and most notably Jay-Z). He established a name for himself through his contributions to Jay-Z's The Blueprint album in 2001. Knowing that he was a rapper at heart rather than a producer, Kanye began shopping around his own work. After creating his mixtape, Through The Wire, he eventually broke onto the music scene with his album, The College Dropout in 2003-2004.</p>
